# Setup of the application and important notes
 1. Download the repository to your local machine.
 ```shell
 git clone https://github.com/uniederstaetter/MultimediaSystem-Project.git
 ```
 2. On importing the project to your IDE, you have to adjust the classpath of the libraries to your machine's. 
 3. For choosing images select **square - grey-scale images only** 
 4. Make sure you use .png or .tif files (.jpeg has not correct behaviour)
 5. **windows user only:** do not use .tif files, windows is not able to show them using the JAVA read function of the image.
